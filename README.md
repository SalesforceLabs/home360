Where to Use Generative AI (GenAI)

* Member Onboarding: GenAI can help streamline the onboarding process by generating personalized welcome emails, membership contracts, and other necessary documentation.
* Communication: Use GenAI to draft emails, SMS, and notices. For example, based on the context, GenAI can draft reminders for due payments, announcements for upcoming events, or responses to common queries.
* Complaint and Request Management: Implement a chatbot powered by GenAI to handle initial member complaints and requests. The chatbot can provide quick responses, gather necessary details, and even suggest solutions based on historical data.
* Event Management: GenAI can help in creating event invitations, reminders, and follow-up messages. It can also assist in generating summaries of event participation and feedback.
* Financial Reports: Use GenAI to generate detailed financial reports and summaries. GenAI can analyze transaction data and provide insights into the financial health of the HOA.

Salesforce Implementation

* Custom Objects: Define custom objects for Members, Properties, Financials, Communication, Complaints/Requests, and Events.
* Automation: Use Salesforce Flow to automate processes such as sending reminders, updating statuses, and generating reports.
* Email Templates: Create email templates for various communication needs, leveraging GenAI for content generation.
* Reports and Dashboards: Use Salesforce's reporting tools to create real-time dashboards and reports for financials, member activities, and property management.
* Einstein AI: Integrate Salesforce Einstein to leverage AI capabilities for predictive analytics, especially in financial forecasting and member engagement.
